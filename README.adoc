= WildFly Development Tools

This project contains development tools for various WildFly projects.

The `org.wildfly.tools:wildfly-parent` is a parent POM which adds minimal functionality to the
`org.jboss:jboss-parent` POM.

The `org.wildfly.tools:ide-config` contains resources for Eclipse formatting configuration files.
These can be used in your IDE as well as in the `net.revelc.code.formatter:formatter-maven-plugin`.

== Releasing

Currently, releasing is a manual task. The versions should be manually updated and ideally commits and tags should be
signed. This is not enforced at the moment.

The default deployment server id for the settings.xml is `ossrh`. This can be overridden with the `sonatype.server.id`
system property. In some cases this might need to be done as we currently release to the legacy https://oss.sonatype.org
server.
